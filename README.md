# Crop Recommendation Website
The crop recommendation software specified in this document is a self-contained product designed to address the evolving needs of modern agriculture. It serves as a standalone tool aimed at optimizing crop selection and cultivation practices based on environmental parameters. Developed as a response to the increasing demand for sustainable farming solutions, this software offers a holistic approach to crop management, leveraging data analytics and machine learning algorithms to provide tailored recommendations to farmers.

**Product Perspective**:
This crop recommendation software operates within the broader context of precision agriculture, which encompasses various technologies and practices aimed at maximizing efficiency and productivity in farming. Additionally, it may integrate with existing farm management systems to streamline data exchange and enhance user experience. The software functions as an intelligent advisor, offering insights and recommendations to farmers, ultimately contributing to improved crop yields, resource conservation, and sustainable agricultural practices.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Pre-requisite

Before you start, you need to have some basic software installed on your computer.

#### Python

Python is a programming language used for the backend of our website. You can download and install Python for free from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to choose the version that says "Latest Python 3 Release."

#### Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime used for the frontend of our website. You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Just click on the "Recommended For Most Users" button to download the installer.

#### Docker (Optional)

Docker is a tool used for running applications in containers. If you're not familiar with containers, don't worry! It just helps us run our website smoothly. You can download and install Docker from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Dependencies

Our website relies on some other software packages to work properly. We'll install these in the next section.

## Description

Our website helps farmers decide which crops to plant based on factors like soil type, climate, and location. It's like having a virtual agricultural advisor at your fingertips!

## API Documentation

[Provide information on how to use the API endpoints.]

## Running the Application

Now, let's get our website up and running!

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    First, we need to download the files for our website onto our computer. Don't worry, it's easy! You just need to open a special program called a "command prompt" and type in some commands.
    
    ` git clone <repository_url> `


2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    After cloning, we need to go to the folder where our website files are saved.

    ` cd crop-recommendation-website `


3. **Install backend dependencies:**

    Next, we'll install some additional software that our website needs to work properly. This is done by typing a special command into the command prompt.

    - ` cd backend `

    - ` pip install -r requirements.txt ` 

    **NOTE:** If the above command gives errors, try:
    ` python -m pip install requirements.txt ` 


4. **Install frontend dependencies:**

    Our website also has some frontend software that needs to be installed.

    - ` cd frontend `

    - ` npm install ` 


### Running via Docker

1. **Build and run the Docker containers:**

    If you installed Docker earlier, this step will be super easy! Just type in one command, and Docker will take care of the rest.

    ` docker-compose up --build `


Now, you should be able to see our website by typing `http://localhost:3000` into your web browser!

### Running individually

1. **Start the backend server:**

    If you prefer not to use Docker, that's okay too! We can start the backend server and frontend server separately.

    ` python manage.py runserver `


2. **Start the frontend server:**

    Open another command prompt window, and navigate to the `frontend` folder inside our project folder.

    ` cd frontend `
    ` npm start ` 


Now, you should be able to see our website by typing `http://localhost:3000` into your web browser!

## Troubleshooting

- **Error:** Docker containers fail to build.
- **Solution:** Make sure Docker is properly installed and running on your computer. If you're not sure, you can find more information [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

- **Error:** Backend server fails to start due to missing dependencies.
- **Solution:** Double-check that you followed all the installation steps correctly. If you're still having trouble, you can ask for help on our community forums.

- **Error:** Frontend server fails to start due to missing or corrupted node modules.
- **Solution:** Make sure you're inside the `frontend` folder when you run the `npm install` command. If that doesn't work, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again.
